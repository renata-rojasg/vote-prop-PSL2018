# üìä Vote proportions in the Brazilian presidential elections in 2018

## üìÅ About This Repository
This repository contains the R implementations and data sets used in the paper entitled "Unit regression models to explain vote proportions in the Brazilian presidential elections in 2018," published at the Revista Colombiana de Estad√≠stica, 47(2), 2024.

## üîß Additional Code Base

Some of the unit regression models used in this analysis rely on custom distribution implementations. These were developed based on code provided in the [UnitDistsForGAMLSS](https://github.com/renata-rojasg/UnitDistsForGAMLSS) GitHub repository. It contains R functions that extend the `gamlss.family` to include unit distributions not currently available in the official GAMLSS package. The unit gamma and unit Lindley were fitted using this repository.

**Note:** The paper relies on a previous release of the UnitDistForGAMLSS, which was deployed at [`figshare`](https://figshare.com/articles/software/UnitDistForGAMLSS/25328575/1) and has its own DOI. Later versions of the repository include additional distributions and provide documentation of the implemented functions.

## üîó Data Availability

The data supporting this research is publicly available and their sources are described in the paper. The final data set is provided here at the [`data_elections_lat_long.csv`](data_elections_lat_long.csv) file.
